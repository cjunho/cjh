The source data to draw Figure 2, 3, 4, 5 are explained as follows.

## Folders
- fig2 folder: 

a) fig2a.csv has Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet, FNO, and POD-DON for clean forcing functions as input data.

b) fig2b.csv has Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet, FNO, and POD-DON for perturbed forcing functions as input data.


- fig3 folder: 

a) fig3d_initial5.csv, fig3d_initial9.csv, and fig3d_initial13.csv have Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet, FNO, and POD-DON for initial condition inputs varying sigma=5, 9, 13.

b) fig3d_force5.csv, fig3d_force10.csv, and fig3d_force20.csv have Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet, FNO, and POD-DON for forcing inputs varying sigma=5, 10, 20.


- fig4 folder: 

a) fig4a_sigma.csv has Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet for 3D forcing inputs varying sigma=1 2, 5, 10. 
fig4a_time.csv has Rel. L2 error evolution of SPecONet for 3D forcing inputs over time. 

b) fig4b_sigma.csv has Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet for initial condition inputs varying sigma=5, 10, 20.


- fig5 folder: 

a) fig5d_sigma.csv has Rel. L2 errors of SPecONet for 3D forcing inputs varying sigma=1 2, 5, 10. 
fig5d_computing_time.csv compares the solution generation time for a range of 50 to 10,000 solutions between the conventional numerical scheme and SPecONet.   

b) fig5d_ensemble_average.csv has ensemble L2 errors of SPecONet resulting from ensemble averaging over a range of 50 to 1000 solutions.
