# User instructions
This repository stores Python codes for simulating rogue waves. Particularly, the simulations are to reproduce soliton-interaction modeled by Potential Flow Equations (PFE), Benney-Luke equations (BLE), and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation (KPE).

## Folders
- BLE : to simulate soliton interactions using BLE.

- PFE_sp2 : to simulate two-soliton-interaction (SP2) with PFE.

- PFE_sp3 : to simulate three-soliton-interaction (SP3) with PFE.

## References
- For BLE: [1], [2].
